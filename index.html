          Willis Haviland Carrier was an American engineer, best known for
          inventing modern air conditioning. Carrier invented the first
          electrical air conditioning unit in 1902. In 1915, he founded Carrier
          Corporation, a company specializing in the manufacture and
          distribution of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)
          systems.

        <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Willis Carrier was born on November 26, 1876, in Angola, New York, the
          son of Duane Williams Carrier (1836–1908) and Elizabeth R. Haviland
          (1845–1888). He studied at Cornell University, graduating in 1901 with
          a BSE degree.

        <h3>Career</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          In Buffalo, New York, on July 17, 1902, in response to an air quality
          problem experienced at the Sackett-Wilhelms Lithographing & Publishing
          Company of Brooklyn, Willis Carrier submitted drawings for what became
          recognized as the world's first modern air conditioning system. The
          1902 installation marked the birth of air conditioning because of the
          addition of humidity control, which led to the recognition by
          authorities in the field that A/C must perform four basic functions:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>control temperature</li>
          <li>control humidity</li>
          <li>control air circulation and ventilation</li>
          <li>cleanse the air</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          After several more years of refinement and field testing, on January
          2, 1906, Carrier was granted U.S. Patent 808,897 for an Apparatus for
          Treating Air, the world's first spray-type air conditioning equipment.
          It was designed to humidify or dehumidify air, heating water for the
          first function and cooling it for the second. In 1906 Carrier
          discovered that "constant dew-point depression provided practically
          constant relative humidity," which later became known among air
          conditioning engineers as the "law of constant dew-point depression."
          On this discovery he based the design of an automatic control system,
          for which he filed a patent claim on May 17, 1907. U.S. Patent
          1,085,971 was issued on February 3, 1914. On December 3, 1911, Carrier
          presented what is perhaps the most significant document ever prepared
          on air conditioning – Rational Psychrometric Formulae – at the annual
          meeting of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. It became
          known as the "Magna Carta of Psychrometrics." This document tied
          together the concepts of relative humidity, absolute humidity, and
          dew-point temperature, thus making it possible to design
          air-conditioning systems to precisely fit the requirements at hand.
          With the onset of World War I in late 1914, the Buffalo Forge Company,
          where Carrier had been employed for 12 years, decided to confine its
          activities entirely to manufacturing. The result was that seven young
          engineers pooled together their life savings of $32,600 to form the
          Carrier Engineering Corporation in New York on June 26, 1915. The
          seven were Carrier, J. Irvine Lyle, Edward T. Murphy, L. Logan Lewis,
          Ernest T. Lyle, Frank Sanna, Alfred E. Stacey, Jr., and Edmund P.
          Heckel. The company eventually settled on Frelinghuysen Avenue in
          Newark, New Jersey.

        <h3>Legacy</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          In 1930, Carrier started Toyo Carrier and Samsung Applications in
          Japan and Korea. South Korea is now the largest producer for air
          conditioning in the world. The Carrier Corporation pioneered the
          design and manufacture of refrigeration machines to cool large spaces.
          By increasing industrial production in the summer months, air
          conditioning revolutionized American life. The introduction of
          residential air conditioning in the 1920s helped start the great
          migration to the Sunbelt. The company became a subsidiary of United
          Technologies Corporation in 1980, and remained so until 2020, when it
          was spun off again as an independent publicly traded company. The
          Carrier Corporation remains a world leader in commercial and
          residential HVAC and refrigeration. In 2018, the Carrier Corporation
          had sales of $18.6 billion and employed 53,000 people.
